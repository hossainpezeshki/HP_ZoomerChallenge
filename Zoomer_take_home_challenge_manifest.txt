Zoomer data science take home challenge
Data set manifest and challenge description

The data consists of two files:
(0. This manifest document)
1. Zoomer_take_home_challenge_training_set.csv
2. Zoomer_take_home_challenge_test_set.csv

The data columns are:
date: yyyy-mm-dd format
calendar_code: 0 or 1 (a code describing certain calendar events)
order_count: an integer (the number of orders received on that date)
restaurant_count: an integer (the number of restaurants delivering on that date)
max_temp: a float (max temperature for that day in degrees Celsius)
min_temp: a float (min temperature for that day in degrees Celsius)
precipitation: a float (millimeters of precipitation on that date)
events: a string (description of weather events on that date)

order_count is absent from the test set.


The goal of the test is to predict the number of orders for any given day. You
are tasked with building a model that can predict the order count in the test
data set. The error of the model is measured as RMSE (root mean squared error).

Your end product should be a CSV file with a single column of predicted order
counts for the dates 2014-10-01 through 2014-10-31. Please do *not* include a
header line.

You may use any programming language that you are comfortable with (e.g. Python,
R, Matlab/Octave, Julia, etc). This is doable in a spreadsheet, but we'd like to
see you write code for this challenge.

Additionally you should answer the following questions:
1. Explain the process you used to predict the order volumes.
2. What other data might help your forecast?
3. Which day of the week has the highest mean # of orders?
4. Which day of the week has the lowest mean # of orders?

Return your CSV of predicted order counts and the answers to roy@zoomer.io

Include your prediction code and the code you used to answer questions 3 and 4.
Include any additional insights or visualizations if you would like.

This project is designed to take less than 4 hours and should be doable in 1 - 2
hours. We are not looking for a perfect prediction, but rather an understanding
of how you approached the problem and the result you produced in a limited
amount of time with limited data.

If you have questions, please send them to roy@zoomer.io
